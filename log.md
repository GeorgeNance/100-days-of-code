### Day 1: May 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on styling and laying out a contact form for a client website

### Day 2: May 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Today I kept continued to work with Gridsome and Tailwind to make a travel website for a client. I started learning more about how to use Graph QL

**Thoughts** Gridsome is very powerful but it has its quirks. I like it because its basically Gatsby for Vue. But there is a real learning curve to graphql. I take back my comment on tailwind, its making my life a bit easier.
