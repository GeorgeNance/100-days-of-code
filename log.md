### Day 2: May 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Today I kept continued to work with Gridsome and Tailwind to make a travel website for a client. I started learning more about how to use Graph QL

**Thoughts** Gridsome is very powerful but it has its quirks. I like it because its basically Gatsby for Vue. But there is a real learning curve to graphql. I take back my comment on tailwind, its making my life a bit easier.

### Day 3: May 3, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  I spent a majority of my time working on some small animations using Anime.css and tailwind.

**Thoughts** Anime.css is neat for quick animations, but if you want to do any sort of complex animations, it is better to write it yourself.
